 * So this is the clean move scene got rid of extra stuff i was playing with
 * So eventaully this will all prolly be scrapped and only be used for reference we want it to look like
 * cause when we have all the othe moving parts we will have to be much more stratigic with the physics
 * ****so right now no extra gravity is on it right now
 * i do have a script for gravity multiipler that makes the swing much better all it is doing is adding extra force down on the block
 * so try this vversion then add gravity multipler script on "puppet_base" and it will feel more natural
 * the important thing of config joint is the linear limit and the anchor thse are adjustable but they are to my liking 
 * also the important is the contact distance with out this contact distance i would get glitchy swings due to the joints pulling on each other 
 * so look into that if you want thats just how i solved it
 * but with all that feel free to scrap this whole method jsut how i hacked it together to work to my liking
